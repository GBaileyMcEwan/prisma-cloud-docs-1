=== Defender Upgrade

[cols="50%a,50%a"]

|Plan to Upgrade Defender Versions 22.12 and Earlier
|With the v32.00.xx (O'Neal) release, Defender versions supported (n, n-1, and n-2) are `v32.xx.xxx`, `v31.xx.xxx`, and `v30.xx.xxx`.
To prepare for this update, you must upgrade your Defenders from version `v22.12.xx.xxx` (Lagrange) or earlier to a later version. Failure to upgrade Defenders will result in disconnection of any Defender version below 30.xx such as 22.12.
