//Moved from Update 4
| *Enhanced Vulnerability Assessment*
| NVD utilizes the 'Running On/With' configuration, which combines nodes based on both vulnerable and non-vulnerable match criteria. This configuration specifies that for a vulnerability to apply, specific criteria must be met, such as packages or operating systems. Prisma Cloud now supports vulnerability assessment based on the 'Running On/With' configuration. This enhancement may result in a more accurate assessment of vulnerabilities, as Prisma Cloud now evaluates previously unassessed 'Running On/With' configurations.

//CWP-56785
