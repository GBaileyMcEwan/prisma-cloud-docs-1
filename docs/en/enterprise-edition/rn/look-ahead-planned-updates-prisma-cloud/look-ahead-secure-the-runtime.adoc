//CWP-48097
|*Vulnerability Management*
|Fixed an issue causing some TAS blobstore controllers not to be listed.

//CWP-48530
|*Vulnerability Management*
|Fixed an issue found during configuration of the Tanzu blobstore scanner. The configuration didn't filter the scanners from the selected cloud controller correctly. Now, when you provide a cloud controller in the Tanzu blobstore scan configuration, only suitable scanners are available to select in the scanner dropdown.

// CWP-46167
|*Vulnerability Management*
|Fixed an issue where scanning scripts that contain binary data caused memory consumption issues.

//CWP-52027
|*Credential Store*
|Fixed an issue where users could not see credentials stored in the Runtime Security credential store, when creating a new System Admin role while specifying cloud accounts only onboarded under Runtime Security.

//CWP-46155
|*Agentless Scanning*
|Agentless scanning now supports scanning of Podman container images deployed to hosts with the default storage driver.

//CWP-52775
|*Installing Serverless Defender*
|Added support for installing serverless defender on AWS with NodeJS runtime, using layer based deployment type and ES modules type.

//CWP-53162
//Added the old blurb as the new blurb is not approved by Ori Kanfer yet. Old ticket CWP-55308
|*Cloud Service Providers*
|Added a new filter in the cloud accounts page in Runtime Security, which filters accounts that are not yet onboarded to the Prisma platform account management under the cloud service providers tab.

In the future, will be able import and manage such accounts fully on the platform cloud service providers page. The goal is to simplify the management of cloud service providers accounts by decommissioning the cloud account management page in Runtime Security.
