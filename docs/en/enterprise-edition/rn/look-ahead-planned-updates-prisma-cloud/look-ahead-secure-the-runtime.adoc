//Moved from Update 4
| *Enhanced Vulnerability Assessment*
|To enhance the accuracy of vulnerability assessments, Prisma Cloud has incorporated support for the 'Running On/With' configuration as outlined by NVD. This configuration, which integrates nodes based on both vulnerable and non-vulnerable criteria, requires specific conditions to be met, such as relevant packages or operating systems, for a vulnerability to be applicable. This enhancement allows Prisma Cloud to consider 'Running On/With' configurations that were not previously assessed. However, it is important to note that the impact of this enhancement is contingent on whether the CVE is assessed through NVD, as vulnerability information from the operating system is prioritized.

//CWP-56785
Added support for serverless defender for java 17 and 21 runtimes.

//CWP-56791
|*Exclude Windows vulnerabilities found in Go packages from UNIX OS*
|Prisma Cloud now excludes vulnerabilities found in Go packages that are specific to Windows from UNIX based operating systems in the Vulnerability Explorer. Select *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Vulnerability Explorer* for a comprehensive list of the detected vulnerabilities.

=== Addressed Issues
[cols="30%a,70%a"]
|===

//CWP-56591
//TODO:Pending blurb approval
|*Enhanced CVE Detection for Older JAR Versions*
|Fixed an issue where incorrect parsing of older JAR file versions resulted in missing CVE entries.

//CWP-56784
//TODO: Pending Approval
|*Improved Handling of Rejected and Disputed CVEs*
|With the transition to the CVE 5.0 dataset, NVD has updated the format of rejected CVE descriptions.
Prisma Cloud now seamlessly identifies 'Rejected' and 'Disputed' statuses of CVEs. The 'Rejected' status is now labeled as 'Rejected reason' in NVD, while CVEs tagged as 'Disputed' are identified using cve.org data source, ensuring accurate vulnerability assessment.

//CWP-56554
//TODO: Pending Approval
|*Fixed Containerized Scan Failure*
|Resolved issue causing containerized scans to fail due to long JSON, particularly when encountering large Java dependency lists. You can now conduct scans without encountering this issue.
