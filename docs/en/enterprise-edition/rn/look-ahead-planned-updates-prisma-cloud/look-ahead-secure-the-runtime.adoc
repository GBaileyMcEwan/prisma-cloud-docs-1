| *Enhanced Vulnerability Assessment*
| NVD uses “Running On/With” configuration as a combination of nodes containing both vulnerable and non-vulnerable match criteria.
This configuration type specifies that for a vulnerability to apply, the specified criteria must be presented. The conditions can refer to packages or OS. Prisma cloud now support vulnerability assessment based on the criteria given on the “Running On/with” configuration.
Customers potentially will have a reduce number of vulnerabilities as prisma cloud used to report some FP vulnerabilities where the “Running on/with” configuration were not evaluated.
