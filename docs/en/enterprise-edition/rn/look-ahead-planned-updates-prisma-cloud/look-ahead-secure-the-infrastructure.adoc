[#changes-in-existing-behavior]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|*Feature*
|*Description*

|*Login Experience Enhancements*
//RLP-135039

|Starting with the 24.5.1 release, users can expect a change in their login experience on the Prisma Cloud console. Updates to the Prisma Cloud login pages will provide support for all available authentication options (excluding IdP-initiated SAML SSO). This update also addresses an issue related to redirection to Palo Alto Networks SSO for login and addresses a bug preventing traversal of deep links for some users.

*Impact*— The SSO Login Page will be updated to more clearly identify OIDC SSO login and add support for Palo Alto Networks SSO login. Redirection to Palo Alto Networks SSO will no longer occur when accessing Prisma Cloud links without a valid session. Deep links will be supported in cases in which previously they were not persisted through login flows.

|*API Rate Limits*
//RLP-129569

|Prisma Cloud uses API https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/rate-limits/[rate limits] at the endpoint level to protect the performance and availability of its services. Rate limits will be applied to additional APIs starting from the 24.5.2 release. Details of these rate limits will be made available in the supporting API documentation and Look Ahead Notices when these limits are introduced. 


|*S3 Flow Logs with Hourly Partition*

tt:[This change was first announced in the look ahead that was published with the 23.1.1 release.]
//RLP-76433 - verify with PM moving blurb from LA to 24.3.1 RN

|If you currently ingest AWS flow logs using S3 with the 24-hour partition, you need to change it to the hourly partition.

To make this change, https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-aws/configure-flow-logs[Configure Flow Logs] to use the hourly partition and enable the required additional fields.

*Impact*— VPC Flow logs with partitions set to *Every 24 hours (default)* was disabled on February 29th, 2024. As a result, you will no longer be able to monitor or receive alerts for these logs. If you have any questions, contact your Prisma Cloud Customer Success Representative immediately.

[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:


. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents the Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-24.4.2.

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.

=== Policy Updates

|*Policy Updates*
|*Description*

2+|*Policy Updates—RQL*

|*AWS EC2 Instance Scheduled Events*
//RLP-134897

|*Changes—* The RQL will be updated to consider the event day until the task is completed and checks for multiple events scheduled for an EC2.

*Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-ec2-describe-instances' AND json.rule = '(_DateTime.ageInDays($.statusEvents[*].notBefore) > -7)'
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-ec2-describe-instances' AND json.rule = 'statusEvents[?any(_DateTime.ageInDays(notBefore) > -7 and _DateTime.ageInDays(notBefore) < 0 and description exists and description does not contain "Completed")] exists'
----

*Impact—* Low. Existing alerts will be resolved when the task scheduled gets completed and new alerts will be generated if there is event scheduled for the EC2.

|*AWS EMR cluster is not enabled with data encryption in transit*
//RLP-131880

|*Changes—* The policy RQL will be updated to ensure the correct match is obtained when the RQL condition `$.X.securityConfiguration contains $.Y.name` is changed to `$.X.securityConfiguration equals $.Y.name`.

*Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-emr-describe-cluster' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-emr-security-configuration' as Y; filter '($.X.status.state does not contain TERMINATING) and ($.X.securityConfiguration contains $.Y.name) and ($.Y.EncryptionConfiguration.EnableInTransitEncryption is false)' ; show X;
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-emr-describe-cluster' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-emr-security-configuration' as Y; filter '($.X.status.state does not contain TERMINATING) and ($.X.securityConfiguration equals $.Y.name) and ($.Y.EncryptionConfiguration.EnableInTransitEncryption is false)' ; show X;
----

*Impact—* Low. Existing alerts will be resolved and new alerts will be generated when the AWS EMR cluster is not enabled with data encryption in transit. 


|*Azure Function app configured with public network access*

//RLP-136115

|*Changes—* The RQL will be updated to check for function app configured with default network configuration

*Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-app-service' AND json.rule = 'kind starts with functionapp and properties.state equal ignore case running and properties.publicNetworkAccess exists and properties.publicNetworkAccess equal ignore case Enabled and config.ipSecurityRestrictions[?any(action equals Allow and ipAddress equals Any)] exists'
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-app-service' AND json.rule = 'kind starts with functionapp and properties.state equal ignore case running and ((properties.publicNetworkAccess exists and properties.publicNetworkAccess equal ignore case Enabled) or (properties.publicNetworkAccess does not exist)) and config.ipSecurityRestrictions[?any(action equals Allow and ipAddress equals Any)] exists'
----

*Impact—* Medium. New Alerts will be generated when the `publicNetworkAccess` for function app is set with default networking configuration.
