|*Description*

|*Blobstore Scanning Defender Upgrade for Tanzu Customers*
//CWP-56798
|Enhanced the existing blobstore scanning feature for Tanzu customers. As a part of this enhancement, existing blobstore scanning defenders will now appear disconnected and new defender instances will be automatically created to replace them. The disconnected blobstore will disappear after 24 hours as part of the retention process. This upgrade excludes Linux and Windows defenders (Full coverage defenders). If you have configured blobstore scanning and assigned it to a specific blobstore defender after the release of 32.04, you are required to manually edit the configurations and change it to a newly created blobstore defender scanner. This release will also introduce a new tile support - Jimmy for TAS.
