=== Defender Upgrade

[cols="30%a,70%a"]
|===
|Plan to Upgrade Defender Versions 22.12 and Earlier
|With the `v32.00` (O'Neal) release, Defender versions supported (n, n-1, and n-2) are `v32.00`, `v31.00`, and `v30.00`.
To prepare for this update, you must upgrade your Defenders from version `v22.12` (Lagrange) or earlier to a later version. Failure to upgrade Defenders will result in disconnection of any Defender version below `v30.00`, such as `v22.12`.

|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

//CWP-52181
|*Agentless Scanning*
|Enabled the scan of non-running hosts by default.
Agentless scanning now scans non-running hosts by default for all newly added accounts.
This change does not affect existing accounts.

//CWP-49984
|*Registry Scanning*
|The following new fields are now displayed for registry scans:

* Scan status—if the scan completed successfully or failed.

* Last scan time—the time at which defender started scanning the registry.

A new unified scan progress indicator shows the status (percentage and number) of scanning and pending registries.

//CWP-47706
|*Vulnerability Management*
|Improved the detection of vulnerabilities on supported Windows OS workloads to fix false negative and false positive alerts related to Windows feeds.


// //CWP-55308
// |*Cloud Account Management*
// |Introduced the *Account Import Status* filter on the *Cloud Accounts* page in *Runtime Security*.
// This feature includes three statuses:

// * *Local accounts:* cloud accounts created in Runtime Security only (and not in the Prisma Cloud console)

// * *Manually imported accounts:* cloud accounts that were manually imported from Prisma Cloud console to Runtime Security in the past prior to the Lagrange release (end of 2022)

// * *Auto-imported accounts:* cloud accounts that originated from Prisma Cloud console and seamlessly imported into Runtime Security.
