|DESCRIPTION

|*Cloud Discovery and Exposure Management*

tt:[*_CSPM - Threat Dectection_*]

tt:[*_23.10.2_*]

//RLP-100718

|xref:../../../content-collections/administration/subscribe-to-cdem.adoc[Cloud Discovery and Exposure Management (CDEM]) is a new subscription that uses machine learning to discover internet-exposed and unmonitored assets within your cloud infrastructure, and enables you to secure these exposed assets with a single click. The assets are seamlessly onboarded to Prisma Cloud. 

When you subscribe, the *Discovery and Exposure Management* dashboard provides visibility into your attack surface and surfaces the top risks and exposure by country . The findings on *Inventory > Unmanaged Assets* enable you to investigate further based on the insights about your shadow assets exposed to the internet and enhance your security posture.

|*Code to Cloud Dashboard*

tt:[*_CSPM - Visibility, Compliance and Governance_*]

tt:[*_23.10.2_*]
//RLP-104734

|Prisma Cloud’s xref:../../../content-collections/dashboards/dashboards-code-to-cloud.adoc[Code to Cloud Dashboard] provides you with a comprehensive assessment of the health of your cloud security posture. Highlights include:

* *Latest Events Tracker—* Alerts you to potential threat activity across your application pipeline.

|*Compute Workloads in Asset Inventory*

tt:[*_CSPM - Visibility, Compliance and Governance_*]

tt:[*_23.10.2_*]

//RLP-104989
|Prisma Cloud Asset Inventory now includes a summarized view of xref:../../../content-collections/cloud-and-software-inventory/compute-workloads.adoc[Compute workloads] (containers images and hosts) across your entire workload for discovery, risk assessment, and securing the runtime.

image::compute-workloads-inventory.gif[]

The findings on *Inventory > Compute Workloads* help you to assess the impact of the vulnerable container images and hosts on your application lifecycle, identify the top impacting vulnerabilities based on critical CVEs, and identify the Cloud providers for the vulnerable hosts along with the other metadata.

|*Unified Vulnerability Management*

tt:[*_CSPM - Visibility, Compliance and Governance_*]

tt:[*_23.10.2_*]

//RLP-104991

|With Code-to-cloud Vulnerability Management, you get complete visibility of all the vulnerable assets across your entire application lifecycle, prioritize the risky and critical ones, assess the risks, and take actions to remediate or mitigate vulnerabilities in Code or in Cloud.

image::<vul-mgmt-gif>
//needs gif image
The Vulnerabilities Dashboard gives you a holistic graphical view of all the vulnerabilities and narrows them down to the most critical and urgent ones, and the ones that are actionable. You get an overview of the top impacting vulnerabilities based on the CVEs, and the vulnerabilities impact by your app lifecycle in a CBDR view.

|*Added a RQL Clause for Vulnerability Search*

tt:[*_CSPM - Visibility, Compliance and Governance_*]

tt:[*_23.10.2_*]

//RLP-104991

|The userinput:[vulnerable where] RQL clause helps you to investigate the vulnerable assets in Prisma Cloud to assess the risk and take actions to remediate and mitigate the vulnerabilities.

image::rql-search-vuln-asset.gif[]

For example, with this userinput:[vulnerable where] RQL clause you can find all assets affected by a CVE ID, vulnerabilities with a CVSS score larger than 9, and vulnerabilities that are Exploitable, Patchable, and in Use.

Refer to the xref:../../../content-collections/search-and-investigate/vulnerability-queries/vulnerability-query-attributes.adoc[Vulnerabilities Query Attributes].

|*Integrated API Visibility*

tt:[*_CSPM - Visibility, Compliance and Governance_*]

tt:[*_23.10.2_*]

//RLP-108380

|Prisma Cloud Inventory now includes continuous discovery of all the API endpoints in your environment. This discovery helps you to prioritize the risks and understand your security posture as well as attack vectors.

image::<gif>
//needs gif image

The xref:../../../content-collections/cloud-and-software-inventory/discover-api-endpoints.adoc[*Inventory > API Endpoints*] gives insights into the discovered endpoints with details on URL Path, the HTTP method, assets relationship, services, Cloud accounts, risk factors, the workload the API endpoints are associated with, and the discovery method.

The API risk profiling gives you insights on policies violated, findings, risk factors indicators, and the associate workload on which the endpoint is hosted.

Prisma Cloud uses existing WAAS runtime rules (agent-based and agentless) to scan traffic and AWS API Gateway configurations within your deployment to list the API endpoints.

|*Prioritize and Remediate Risks*

tt:[*_CSPM - Visibility, Compliance and Governance_*]

tt:[*_23.10.2_*]

//RLP-104994

|Prisma Cloud *Attack Path Analysis* identifies and collects a wide range of security signals to assist with risk prioritization. These signals include vulnerabilities in cloud resources, public exposure of resources to the internet, overly permissive credentials, and threat context, such as potentially malicious traffic or IP addresses. 

By intelligently analyzing and correlating these signals, along with considering the business context of an application or data at risk, Prisma Cloud can guide your security teams to address the most critical risks first. This level of prioritization ensures that your organization can focus on securing your most valuable assets while minimizing the risk of data breaches or other threats. Prisma Cloud helps you identify the xref:../../../content-collections/governance/attack-path-policies[Attack Paths], which are presented in a graph view and offer valuable security context to protect your assets against high-risk threats.
