=== Description

This policy ensures that security rules in Palo Alto Networks devices do not use 'any' for both 'source_ip' and 'destination_ip' simultaneously. Configuring both source and destination IPs to 'any' in a security rule can lead to overly broad permissions, potentially exposing the network to unintended traffic. The policy requires that at least one of these attributes, either `source_ip` or `destination_ip`, is set to a specific value other than 'any' to enforce more granular and secure traffic filtering.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Palo Alto Networks*

* *Resource:* panos_security_rule
* *Attributes:* source_ip, destination_ip

To comply with this policy, ensure that either `source_ip` or `destination_ip` (or both) in your `panos_security_rule` resources are defined with specific IP addresses or ranges instead of 'any'. This approach helps in defining precise and secure network traffic rules.

Secure code example:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Ensure specific IPs are used in security rules
  tasks:
    - name: Security_rule_fail_1
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_security_rule:
        name: "example-rule"
-        source_ip: ['any']
-        destination_ip: ['any']
+        source_ip: ['192.168.1.0/24']
+        destination_ip: ['10.1.2.0/24']
----

Specifying exact IP addresses or ranges for `source_ip` and `destination_ip` ensures that the security rule does not unintentionally permit all traffic, aligning with this policy's requirements.
