=== Description

This policy ensures that all security policies in Palo Alto Networks devices have a populated 'description' field. Descriptions are essential for providing context and understanding the purpose of each security rule, facilitating easier management and auditing of security policies. This check verifies that the `description` attribute in `panos_security_rule` resources is not empty, promoting better documentation and clarity in security rule definitions.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Palo Alto Networks*

* *Resource:* panos_security_rule
* *Attribute:* description

To comply with this policy, make sure that every `panos_security_rule` resource includes a non-empty `description` attribute. This description should provide clear and concise information about the rule's purpose, helping in the effective management and documentation of security policies.

Secure code example:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Ensure security rule descriptions are detailed
  tasks:
    - name: Task
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_security_rule:
        ...
+        description: "Block traffic from untrusted zones to critical servers"
----

Including meaningful descriptions in your security rules aligns with this policy, enhancing the understandability and maintainability of your security policies.
