=== Description

A Samsara API Key is a critical component for authenticating and authorizing access to Samsara's cloud-based services, enabling seamless integration and interaction with Samsara's extensive range of IoT solutions. These solutions encompass vehicle telematics, driver safety, mobile workflow, compliance, asset tracking, and operational insights. The API key acts as a secure token, ensuring that only authorized devices, applications, or services can access the Samsara API, thereby protecting the integrity and confidentiality of the data exchanged.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Samsara*

If your Samsara API key is exposed, immediately regenerate a new key through your Sansara account and replace the compromised key in all your applications and services:

1. **Log into the Samsara Dashboard**: Access your account on the Samsara dashboard using your credentials.

2. **Access API Settings**: Navigate to the settings or configuration section of your dashboard, and locate the API access or integration settings.

3. **Regenerate API Key**: Look for the option to manage your API keys. Use the functionality provided to invalidate the compromised API key and generate a new one. This action prevents any further use of the old key.

4. **Update Systems with New API Key**: Replace the compromised API key in all your applications, integrations, or systems with the newly generated API key to restore secure access.

5. **Review API Access and Usage**: After replacing the API key, it's advisable to review the access logs and usage patterns to identify any unauthorized access or suspicious activities. This can help in understanding the impact of the exposure and in strengthening security measures.

6. **Implement Best Practices**: To prevent future exposures, ensure that API keys are stored securely, access is restricted based on the principle of least privilege, and regular audits of API usage are conducted. Consider implementing additional layers of security, such as IP whitelisting and strict access controls.

By taking immediate action to regenerate a compromised Samsara API Key and updating your systems, you effectively mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to your Samsara services. Regularly monitoring and managing API keys are crucial steps in maintaining the security of your integration with Samsara's platform. For detailed procedures and best practices, always refer to the latest Samsara documentation and support resources.
