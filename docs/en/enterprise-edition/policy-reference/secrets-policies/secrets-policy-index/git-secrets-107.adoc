=== Description

An OpenAI API Key is a secure and unique identifier used to authenticate requests to OpenAI's API services, including access to powerful AI models for various applications. The API key ensures that only authorized users or applications can interact with OpenAI's services, facilitating the control and management of usage according to the specified terms and conditions. Exposed API keys can lead to exposed data and unplanned charges.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*OpenAI*

To address the exposure of an OpenAI API Key, follow these remediation steps to ensure that your access remains secure. OpenAI provides a mechanism to manage API keys directly through its platform:

1. Log in to your OpenAI account.
2. Navigate to the API section in your account settings.
3. Find the API keys management page.
4. If you believe your API key has been compromised or if you wish to invalidate an existing key for any reason, click on the option to regenerate a new API key.
5. Immediately replace the compromised API key in your application or service with the new API key provided.

By regenerating a new API key and updating your application's configuration, you effectively invalidate the previous API key, preventing unauthorized use. It's crucial to replace the exposed key in all applications and services where it was used to ensure no disruption in accessing OpenAI's API services. Additionally, regularly reviewing and managing your API keys can help maintain the security of your applications. Always refer to OpenAI's official documentation for the most current guidance and best practices in managing API keys.
