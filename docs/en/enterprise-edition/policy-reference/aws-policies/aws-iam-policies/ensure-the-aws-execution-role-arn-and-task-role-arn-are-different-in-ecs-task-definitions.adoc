=== Description 

In Amazon ECS, the execution role and the task role serve different purposes and should be distinct:

* The *execution role* is used by the ECS agent to make AWS API calls on your behalf.
* The *task role* grants permissions to the tasks themselves.

Using the same role for both can lead to unnecessary permissions being granted, increasing security risks. Separating these roles ensures a more granular and secure permission model.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_ecs_task_definition
* *Arguments:*  execution_role_arn, task_role_arn

Ensure that the `execution_role_arn` does not match the `task_role_arn`
