== Begin you Prisma Cloud Journey

Prisma Cloud's administrative console surfaces up the metrics that matter most to you on the Home page. When you first login you are provided with a quick snapshot of urgent anomalies detected, potential attack paths, vulnerabilities, and security issues anticipated by combining multiple data sources such network flow logs, host/container logs, DNS logs, audit trails, cloud configurations, and security intelligence feeds.

Before you move on to interacting with the Prisma Cloud administrative console, let's get familiar with some of the key focus areas on the Home screen:
