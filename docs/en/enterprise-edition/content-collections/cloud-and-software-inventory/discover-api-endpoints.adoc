== Integrated API Endpoints Visibility

As you xref:../connect/connect-cloud-accounts/connect-cloud-accounts.adoc[Connect your Cloud Accounts], Prisma Cloud provides a continuous discovery of all the API endpoints in your deployment. This discovery helps you to prioritize the risks and understand your security posture as well as attack vectors.

**Sources of API Discovery**

Prisma Cloud uses existing WAAS runtime rules (agent-based and agentless) to scan traffic and AWS API Gateway configurations within your deployment to list the API Endpoints on *Inventory > API Endpoints*.
//P2 (early Nov)- Automatic Agentless WAAS discovery without any configurations. Enable *Web & API Security*

//P2 - *Collections > Cloud Security > Settings > Providers > Cloud Accounts > WAAS API Scanning
This page helps you to: 

* Discover all the API endpoints in your workloads and conduct risk assessments.
** Locate the high-risk API endpoints within your deployment and determine their associated Cloud accounts, regions, and services
** Assess the services in your Cloud account that have risky API endpoints.
** Detect shadow APIs that handle sensitive information and lack proper authentication measures.

=== Discover and Monitor API Endpoints

//P2 (early Nov)* Enable *Web & API Security* at the time you xref:../connect/connect-cloud-accounts/connect-cloud-accounts.adoc[Connect Cloud Accounts]. This is for automated Agentless Discovery - only for AWS
//<TBD> - update the toggle in cloud account platform page.

The *Inventory > API Endpoints* gives insights into the discovered endpoints with details on URL Path, the HTTP method, assets relationship, services, Cloud accounts, risk factors, the workload the API endpoints are associated with, and the discovery method.
You can group the discovered endpoints by Cloud type, service name, region, workload, and server either in a Cards view or a Table view. 
For each endpoint Prisma Cloud provides comprehensive overview on:

* Internet Exposure
* Sensitive Data Exposure
* Authentication
* Malicious Activity 
* Usage statistics
* Message Structure

Out of all the discovered endpoints, you can search and filter on various parameters, say for example show all the internet exposed endpoints, endpoints with sensitive data, the HTTP methods, and recently changed/observed API endpoints.

=== API Risk Profiling and Findings

Select an API Endpoint to understand its findings for risk assessment.

The API risk profiling gives you insights on policies violated, findings, the risk factors indicators, and the associate workload on which the endpoint is hosted.
The risk factors assist in discovering API endpoints exposed to the internet, endpoints flagged with observed malicious activity, endpoints that can be accessed without authentication, as well as the endpoints in which sensitive data is exchanged.

//Show and explain the attack paths with an example?
//Today we show the attack path on the host and not on the API endpoint.
Refer to xref:../runtime-security/waas/waas-api-discovery.adoc[API Discovery - Path risks profiling] for more details.

=== Investigate API Endpoints

The WAAS integration in platform also enable you to easily search and investigate the WAAS assets.
Say, for example, to show all the asset types of API Endpoints, where the finding name has some injections.

[.procedure]

. Select *Investigate > Search*.
. Run the query with the following query attributes and values:
+
FIND: Asset
+
Asset Type: API Endpoint
+
WHERE: Finding Name in "injection"

. Select *Search*.
+
<gif-env-not-ready> //no data
+
You can see the endpoints and the associated findings. For example highlight a SQL injection Web attack and only see the endpoints affected by this attack.
+
You can further click on an endpoint and *View Details* of the attack findings. 

=== What's Next

Once you onboard your Cloud accounts and assess the attack vector, you can now set WAAS rules to enforce policies on these discovered endpoints, trigger WAAS events to generate alerts when the rules are violated, and take informed decisions to protect your applications.
