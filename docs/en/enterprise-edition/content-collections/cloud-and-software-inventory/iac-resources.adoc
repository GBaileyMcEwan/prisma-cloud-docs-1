== IaC Resources

As a part of the unified asset inventory on Prisma Cloud, you can view a contextual inventory of all IaC Resources across various cloud accounts and repositories. Using Traceability unique to Application Security, the inventory gives you an asset list of interconnected frameworks.
Every user on Prisma Cloud can use the information visible on the IaC Resource Inventory specific to their permissions and role.

* *Code Inventory Exploration*

As a Developer, you can use the comprehensive view of resources within code across diverse frameworks, enabling you to prioritize assets that require attention for posture enhancement. You can also identify the prevalence of specific resources and establish framework-specific goals for IaC resources.

*Traceability*

For Developers, Security Engineers and DevOps personnel, you can identify code assets that are either drifting or lying dormant. Assets in a drift state signify cloud resources that diverge from the corresponding code and require changes in the codebase or within the cloud environment. The dormant state of code assets pertains to undeployed code, potentially causing noise in code reviews or posing future risks in the cloud. These assets should either be removed or deployed promptly. You can also monitor resources associated with traced Cloud Security Posture Management alerts derived from the code assets.

=== IaC Resource Inventory

Familiarize yourself with the IaC Resource Inventory, a tabulated information listed by frameworks.

* *Framework*: The choice of IaC language employed by the asset influences the associated framework.

* *Total*: This represents the overall number of IaC assets.

* *Pass*: These resources have undergone the scan without issues.

* *Fail*: These refer to resources that have encountered a few alerts, indicating areas that may require attention.

* *Resources with Code Issues*: This metric reveals the total count of code-related issues within a framework across all levels of severity.

* *Resources with Vulnerabilities*: This metric provides insight into the total number of vulnerabilities identified within a framework, spanning across all levels of severity.

After you have completed the inventory monitoring, you can delve into individual issues for a more detailed assessment and implement necessary remediation measures if required.

==== Add Filters

You can further refine the inventory metrics to focus exclusively on Infrastructure as Code (IaC) assets, allowing you to see the most susceptible assets to misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. This feature provides a granular breakdown of alerts, providing valuable insights into their potential impact on the runtime posture.

For IaC Resources, there is support for a range of filters:

* *Repository:* Refers to the specific repository housing the IaC asset.
* *IaC Resource Type:* Specifies the type of IaC resource in the build time context.
* *Code Issue Severity:* Highlights the severity level of any detected misconfigurations.
* *Vulnerability Severity:* Identifies the severity level of vulnerabilities.
* *Framework:* Indicates the framework used in the IaC implementation.
* *IaC Resource Tag:* Offers insights into the tags associated with the IaC resource.
* *Code Provider:* Indicates the cloud service provider associated with the asset.
* *Last Modified By:* Provides information on the last user who made the modifications.
