== IaC Resources

The integration of code assets into the unified asset inventory alongside existing assets.

All Infrastructure as Code (IaC) resource assets will be categorized under the unified IaC resource asset type.

The background context emphasizes the goal of providing a comprehensive view of assets across various Cloud Accounts and Repositories, with an emphasis on establishing relationships between different asset types, including IaC resources.

The content highlights three primary use cases:

* **Code Inventory Exploration**: You can assess the number of resources in code across different frameworks, enabling you to prioritize and focus on improving their posture. You can also identify common resources and set goals for framework usage.

* **Traceability**: You can identify code assets that are either drifting (not aligned with the code) or unused. You can take corrective action, either in the code or in the cloud, to align these assets. You can also track resources with alerts derived from code assets, allowing you to focus on assets with real alerts.

* **Relationships**: You are provided with a visual representation of dependencies between IaC resources. This contextualization aids in prioritization and more detailed exploration of the asset.
