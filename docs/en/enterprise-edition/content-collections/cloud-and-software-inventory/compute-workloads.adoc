== Compute Workloads in Assets Inventory

Prisma Cloud Asset Inventory includes Compute workload asset findings for container images and hosts across your entire workload for risk assessment.
The asset findings discover the relationships between the registry images and the deployed images.
The discovery of compute workloads also prioritizes the compute workloads based on top impactful vulnerabilites, thus gives you a better understanding of your security posture.

In the Asset Inventory for Compute Workload, you can:

* Discover compute workload assets (Container images and Hosts) accross your Cloud environment.
* Get a total count of container images and hosts across your Cloud environment.
* View a total count of vulnerable images and hosts in Asset Inventory.

** Identify the Cloud providers of the images and filter the vulnerable images.
** View how the container images are spread across the application lifecycle.
** Assess the images and hosts for the most impactful vulnerabilities, based on CVEs that are critical, exploitable, or patchable.
** Assess the vulnerable hosts for attack paths, alerts, risk factors, and vulnerabilities.
** Review posture violations for a resource.

=== Discover Compute Workload Assets

Go to *Inventory > Compute Workloads* for an overview of all the container images and hosts in your environment, which are the risky ones and which Cloud providers they belong to.

Understand the security posture of container images and hosts and identify the image and host security related details.

==== Risk Assessment for Container Images

Go to *Inventory > Compute Workloads > Container Images* and assess the container images to understand the image-related risks.

Trace how the vulnerable container images are spread across your application lifecycle stages.
You can sort the results based on images with most impactful vulnerabilites, running containers with these vulnerable images, and the most recent scanned vulnerable images.

As you select a container image, you get more image information, alerts profile and the policies violated, what vulnerabilities profile, risky processes, risky packages installed in the image, and labels associated with that image.

==== Risk Assessment for Hosts

Go to *Inventory > Compute Workloads > Hosts* to assess the security posture for the most impactful hosts based on CVEs that are critical and high, exploitable, or patchable.

You can filter out only the vulnerable hosts and also sort the list based on the most impactful vulnerabilites, and the recent vulnerable hosts scanned.

Select a host to view more host information in the side panel, the attack paths, audit trail, alerts profile and the policies violated, threat detection findings on the host, risk factors and impactful Vulnerabilities, package information, overy permissive IAM details on the host, and relationship with other assets.

On the alerts profile, you can see the alert policies violated by the vulnerable container images and hosts, you can download this data in a tabular format.
Select an alert to further investigate the alerts policies under *Governance > Alerts*.
