== Compute Workloads in Asset Inventory

Prisma Cloud Asset Inventory includes findings from Compute workloads (container images and hosts) and helps in discovery and risk assessment.

The asset findings discover the relationships between the registry images and the deployed images.
The discovery helps you to prioritize the compute workloads based on the top impactful vulnerabilities, and gives you a better understanding of your security posture.

In the Asset Inventory for Compute Workload, you can:

* Discover compute workload assets (container images and hosts) across your Cloud environment.
* Get a total count of container images and hosts across your workload.
* View a total count of vulnerable images and hosts.

** Identify the Cloud providers of the images and filter the vulnerable images.
** View how the container images are spread across the application lifecycle.
** Assess the images and hosts for the most impactful vulnerabilities, based on CVEs that are critical, exploitable, or patchable.
** Assess the vulnerable hosts for attack paths, alerts, risk factors, and vulnerabilities.

=== Discover Compute Workload Assets

Go to *Inventory > Compute Workloads* for an overview of all the container images and hosts in your environment, which are the risky ones and which Cloud providers do they belong to.

Understand the security posture of container images and hosts and identify the image and host security related risks.

==== Risk Assessment for Container Images

Go to *Inventory > Compute Workloads > Container Images* and assess the container images to understand the image-related risks.

Trace how the vulnerable container images are spread across your application lifecycle stages.
You can sort the results based on images with most impactful vulnerabilities, running containers with these vulnerable images, and the most recent scanned vulnerable images.

Select a container image, to get more information, such as alerts profile and the policies violated, vulnerabilities profile, risky processes, risky packages installed in the image, and labels associated with that image.

==== Risk Assessment for Hosts

Go to *Inventory > Compute Workloads > Hosts* to assess the security posture for the most impactful hosts based on CVEs that are critical and high, exploitable, or patchable.

You can filter the vulnerable hosts and also sort the list based on the most impactful vulnerabilities, and the recent vulnerable hosts scanned.

Select a host to view more information such as, the attack paths, audit trail, alerts profile and the policies violated, threat detection findings on the host, risk factors and impactful Vulnerabilities, package information, over permissive IAM details on the host, and the host's relationship with other assets.

=== What's Next

On the alerts profile, you can see the alert policies violated by the vulnerable container images and hosts, and download the alert profile data for container images in a tabular format.

Select an alert to further investigate cloud workload alert policies violated under xref::../governance/governance.adoc[Prisma Cloud Policies].
