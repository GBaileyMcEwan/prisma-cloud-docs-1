|DESCRIPTION

|*AppDNA for Application Context*

tt:[*_CSPM - Visibility, Compliance and Governance_*]

tt:[*_23.10.2_*]

|The new API Endpoints Inventory provides visibility into potential risks of HTTP API endpoints discovered on your onboarded AWS accounts.

* View comprehensive details on the API endpoint including information on the asset/workload associated with the endpoint, the risk factors, content type, traffic statistics, and body schema for an HTTP POST request.
* Leverage out-of-the-box policies for API-related risks & incidents such as unauthenticated API endpoints, web attacks, bot behavior, and web scraping.

|*Code-to-Cloud Remediation*

tt:[*_CSPM - Visibility, Compliance and Governance_*]

tt:[*_23.10.2_*]

|Reduce the noise and focus on what truly matters most with highly contextual, high fidelity alerts from a combination of security signals such as Internet Exposure, Overly Permissive IAM roles, Misconfigurations, and Critical Vulnerabilities.

* View asset and alert details in a single click, including security findings, remediation recommendations, and asset relationships.

* Leverage out-of-the-box policies that generate alerts on critical Attack Paths to bring automated efficiency and visibility into the most critical issues in your cloud environment.

* Gain a visual understanding of the context behind an alert with the new graph visualization that displays evidence of why the alert was generated.

tt:[*_23.10.2_*]

|Stay informed on the latest events and security highlights on the most critical security activities across your environment.

* Use the at-a-glance, comprehensive overview of the application lifecycle to embrace a shift-left approach for proactively detecting and addressing issues during the code and build stages; recognize the positive impact of finding and fixing issues earlier in the application lifecycle.
* Define your applications or teams and assign owners to resolve identified risks.
* Celebrate teams making security improvements and identify outliers who require assistance.

|*Just-in-time Access (CIEM)*

tt:[*_CIEM - IAM Security_*]

tt:[*_23.10.2_*]

|Authorize users with secure and temporary access to cloud services, without slowing down your teams.

* Grant users time-limited permissions to specific cloud services and reduce the risk of permission creep.

[#new-policies1]
=== New Policies

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|NEW POLICIES
|DESCRIPTION
//The following are just mock data, must be updated with the 10.2 release when available

|*GCP backend bucket having dangling GCP Storage bucket*

tt:[*_23.10.1_*]

//RLP-112675
|Identifies the GCP backend buckets having dangling GCP Storage bucket.

A GCP backend bucket is usually used by GCP Load Balancers for serving static content. Such setups can also have DNS pointing to the load balancer's IP for easy human access. A GCP backend bucket pointing to a GCP storage bucket that doesn't exist in the same project is a potential risk of bucket takeover as well as at risk of subdomain takeover. An attacker can exploit such a setup by creating a GCP Storage bucket with the same name in their own GCP project, thus receiving all requests redirected to this backend bucket from the load balancer to an attacker-controlled GCP Storage bucket. This attacker-controlled bucket can be used to serve malicious content to perform phishing attacks, spread malware, or engage in other illegal activities.

As a best practice, it is recommended to review and protect GCP storage buckets bound to a GCP backend bucket from accidental deletion. Delete the GCP backend bucket if it points to a non-existent GCP storage bucket.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'gcloud-compute-backend-bucket' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'gcloud-storage-buckets-list' as Y; filter ' not (Y.name intersects X.bucketName) '; show X;
