== Role-based access control for Docker Engine

Support for the *Docker Access Control* at *Defend > Access > Docker* and *Access User* role at *Manage > Authentication > Roles* reached End of Support in Newton Update 1 (v31.01.123).

Use an xref:./open-policy-agent.adoc#open-policy-agent[Open Policy Agent] to control access instead.
