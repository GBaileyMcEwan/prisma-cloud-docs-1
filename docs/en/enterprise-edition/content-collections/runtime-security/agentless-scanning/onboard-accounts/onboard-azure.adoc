== Onboard Azure Accounts for Agentless Scanning

Agentless scanning lets you inspect the risks and vulnerabilities of a cloud workload without having to install an agent or affecting the execution of the workload. Prisma Cloud gives you the flexibility to choose between agentless and agent-based security using Defenders. Currently, Prisma Cloud supports agentless scanning on Azure hosts, containers, and clusters for vulnerabilities and compliance. To learn more about how agentless scanning works, refer to our article on xref:../agentless-scanning-results.adoc[Agentless scanning architecture.]
