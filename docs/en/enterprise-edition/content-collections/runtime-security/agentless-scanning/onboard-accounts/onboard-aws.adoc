== Onboard AWS Accounts for Agentless Scanning

Prisma Cloud gives you the flexibility to choose between agentless security and agent-based security using Defenders. Agentless scanning lets you inspect the risks and vulnerabilities of a cloud workload or container image without installing an agent or affecting the execution of your workload. Prisma Cloud supports agentless scanning for vulnerabilities and compliance on AWS hosts, containers, and clusters.
