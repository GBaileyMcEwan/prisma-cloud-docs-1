Alert profiles specify which events should trigger the alert machinery, and to which channel alerts are sent.
You can send alerts to any combination of channels by creating multiple alert profiles.

Alert profiles consist of two parts:

*(1) Alert settings -- Who should get the alerts, and on what channel?*
Configure Prisma Cloud to integrate with your messaging service and specify the people or places where alerts should be sent.
For example, configure the email channel and specify a list of all the email addresses where alerts should be sent.
Or for JIRA, configure the project where the issue should be created, along with the type of issue, priority, assignee, and so on.

If you use multi-factor authentication, you must create an exception or app-specific password to allow Console to authenticate to the service.
