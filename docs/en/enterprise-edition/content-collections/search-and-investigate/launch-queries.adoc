== Launch Queries

Investigate > Overview provides a quick and simple option to launch your queries. You get out-of-the-box visibility and risk prioritization filtering with minimal learning.

Before you write a custom query, you can view the queries you recently searched or use one of the top saved queries that allow you to take advantage of the rich set of AI-powered security research provided by Prisma Cloud. You can choose to either create a new search or directly load a query from the *Query Library* (search suggestions) and view the search results in the interactive graph view (default, when available depending on the query type) or the table view. 

//load query and then mention build from scratch
//create a new search by loading a saved query or building your custom query from scratch
//may have to replace NLP with Keyword and a query example that matches 

You can launch a query using any of the following methods:

[.procedure]

. Select Investigate > Overview.

.. Choose from the *Recent Searches* that displays the most recent query search results along with the query title and the timestamp for when it was run. 
.. You can view up to 5 pages and each page lists 10 recent searches. 
.. *Saved Searches* displays the top 10 most popular queries along with query title, who created it (author), and a description of the query.
.. Select any query listed under *Recent Searches* or *Saved Queries* to see the details in graph or table format. 
.. With additional keywords you get more details on what you want to investigate. The blinking asset node guides you to view the asset and you can then expand your query by adding additional findings.
