=== Fix Vulnerability Issues

On *Projects* *Vulnerabilities* view you see CVE issues that have an automatic fix on the console. You can choose to remediate a single CVE issue or choose to fix all issues in the issue block. When fixing the issue, the CVE *Root version* gets bumped to the latest version from a Pull Request that you need to submit from the *Fix cart*. The issue block will continue to be seen till the Pull Request with the fix is not merged.

[.procedure]

. Select *Code Security > Projects* and then select *Vulnerabilities* view.

. Access any issue block and then select *Fix* corresponding to the issue.

When fixing the issue, you can verify all CVEâ€™s getting fixed by a verification status corresponding to the CVE.

In this example you see fixing `CVE-2021-33194` automatically fixes `CVE-2022-30322` with the current remediation.
