== Monitor and Manage Code Build Issues

In the modern software development landscape, code to cloud security has emerged as a critical concern. This approach focuses on securing applications from the initial code development phase to deployment and operation in the cloud environment. A significant aspect of code to cloud security is ensuring code security during the build phase, which involves identifying and addressing vulnerabilities and security issues before code is deployed.

Before you begin, ensure you have connected [Code & Build Providers] and [enabled subscriptions] on Application Security.
