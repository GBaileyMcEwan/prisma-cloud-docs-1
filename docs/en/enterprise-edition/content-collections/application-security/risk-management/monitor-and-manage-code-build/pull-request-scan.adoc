=== Pull Request Scans

Pull request scans are event driven scans that are run on branches with open Pull Requests (PR) from your integrated repositories. The scan results are based on the default *Enforcement* thresholds or custom configurations.

For more information on Enforcement, refer to xref:enforcement.adoc[Enforcement].

=== Manage Pull Request Scan Results

You can manage pull request scan results within the pull request itself or through the Prisma Cloud Console.

==== On the Pull Request:

Errors detected by a PR scan triggered by changes to a resource are displayed as a PR comment within the pull request. Details of the error and suggested remediation can be viewed by clicking the arrow in the comment.

NOTE: 

During pull request (PR) scans, Prisma Cloud reviews all modified resources within the PR. However, due to constraints in many version control systems (VCS), comments can only be added to modified lines. Despite this limitation, the scanner accurately identifies the relevant lines for each comment. It's important to note that scan results are not filtered on a line-by-line basis, so results for other lines in the same resource may also be provided, even if only one line was changed.

This approach is particularly valuable for customers who already have existing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with identified issues. By identifying these issues during pull requests when changes are made, Prisma Cloud can expedite the resolution of older issues. While this may introduce additional notifications, it ensures that issues within actively modified resources are not overlooked.

==== On the Prisma Cloud Console

In addition, you can view results of a pull request scan on the Prisma Cloud console: In *Application Security*, select *Projects* and click the *VCS Pull Requests* tab.
