== Connect GitLab Self-Managed  

Integrate Prisma Cloud with your GitLab version control system to gain visibility into, and monitor the systems, technologies, configurations, and pipelines that make up the GitLab self-managed platform.
This integration enables security scans to identify Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) misconfigurations, Software Composition Analysis (SCA) vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, license mis-compliance and CI/CD pipeline risks in your GitLab environment, allowing you to understand and fix issues as soon as they are detected, resulting in an enhanced security posture for your organization.

[.procedure]

. Before you begin:
+
* Add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Application Security to an https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/enable-access-prisma-cloud-console.html[allow list], to enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console
* Grant *Administrator* permissions in the relevant GitLab organization to the Prisma user integrating Prisma Cloud with GitLab self-managed

. On the Prisma Cloud Application Security console.

.. In Application Security, select *Settings > *Connect Provider* > *Code & Build Providers* > *GitLab Self-managed* (under Code Repositories).

.. Enter your domain or IP in the *Configure Domain* step of the installation wizard> *Register*.
+
NOTE: The domain is the hostname associated with your self-hosted GitLab instance.
+
The *Register OAUTH app* step of the wizard is displayed.
.. Copy the pre-populated *Application Name* and *Redirect URL* values from the wizard.

. On GitLab Self-managed.

.. Create an application: Access *GitLab Self-Managed > User Settings > Applications* and paste the copied *Application Name* and *Redirect URL* in their respective fields.
.. Select *api* as the application scope > *Save application*.
.. Copy the generated *Application ID* and *Secret* values that are displayed after the application is created.

. In the *Set Client ID and Secret* step of the Prisma Cloud integration wizard.

.. Paste the copied *Application ID* and *Secret* values > *Authorize*.
+
The *Select Repositories* step of the wizard is displayed.

.. Select which repositories will be scanned. 
+
* *Permit all existing repositories* 
* *Permit all existing and future repositories*.  This is the recommended option to ensure complete coverage and successful operation of all features. 
* *Choose from repository list* > Select repositories

.. Select *Next* > *Done* in the *Status* step of the wizard to complete the integration.

. Verify successful integration: select *Settings* > *Code & Build Providers*.
+
Confirm that the status of the integrated *GitLab* repositories displays *Connected* under *Status*.
+
NOTE: It may take up to 3 minutes for the integration status to be updated and show as *Succeeded*.

. Next step: Monitor and manage scan results.
+
Your selected GitLab repositories will be visible on the *Repositories* page. The next GitLab scan will include the selected repositories. 

To view the scan results and resolve issues select *Application Security* > *Projects*. See xref:../../../risk-management/monitor-code-build-issues.adoc[here] for more information.

[#multi-integrate-]
=== Support for multiple integrations

Prisma Cloud supports multiple integrations for GitLab Self-Managed. After the initial integration with Prisma Cloud, you can continue to add additional organizations and workspaces using a different or the same user or team token.

Multiple integrations from a single Prisma Cloud account enables you to:

* View a list of integrations on a single console
* Add additional integrations.
* Delete an existing integration
+
NOTE: Selecting a repository for a specific integration will restrict you from selecting the same repository in another integration.

[.procedure]

. Add additional integrations to a configured GitLab Self-Managed account.

. In Application Security, select *Settings > *Connect Provider* > *Code & Build Providers* > *GitLab Self-managed* (under Code Repositories).

.. Select *Add Integration* in the wizard.
+
The *Configure Domain* step of the installation wizard is displayed.
//image::application-security/gl-sm-add-integration.png

.. Configure your Domain as stated in step *1* of the GitLab Self-Managed installation process above and then proceed to execute steps *2-6* of the installation procedure.
+
The new integration is displayed on the landing page of the wizard. You can view your configured GitLab Self-managed repositories under *Code Repositories* on the *Code & Build Providers* page. The next scan of your GitLab Self-Managed systems will include the new integrations with their configured repositories, and the results will be displayed in xref:../../../risk-prevention/code/monitor-fix-issues-in-scan.adoc[Monitor and Fix Issues in Your Scans].

// verify if Code Security has not been changed

[.task]
=== Manage Integrations

Manage integrations from the integration wizard.

[.procedure]

. Access the GitLab Self-Managed integration wizard - see *step 1* of <<multi-integrate,Support for multiple integrations>> above > select the menu under *Actions*.
