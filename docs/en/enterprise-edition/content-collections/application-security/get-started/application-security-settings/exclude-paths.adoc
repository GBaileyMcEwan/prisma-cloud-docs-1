=== Exclude Paths from Application Security scans

Configure your application security scan by adding rules to an integrated repository.
New rules are scanned only for a single defined repository.
However, you can configure multiple repositories to a defined rule.

By default, Prisma Cloud scans all paths in all repositories.
You can add a rule to specify which repository paths to exclude when scanning.
Before you begin adding rules, disable the default configuration for all repositories.

[.procedure]

. Select *Settings > Code Configuration* to configure your integrated repository.

. Enter paths to exclude from the repository.

.. Type paths to exclude within the selected repository.
+
Use comma (,) to list more than one file or path.
+
In this example, On Enter Paths, type `test, _test, \/test\/` this will exclude any path or file with the specified context.
