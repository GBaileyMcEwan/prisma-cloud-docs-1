== Select Transporter and ensure Domain name consistency during Integration

When integrating a self-hosted version control system (VCS) such as GitLab Self Managed or GitHub Server with Prisma Cloud using a Transporter, it is essential to maintain consistency in the domain name throughout the integration. This means aligning the domain name provided during the integration wizard matches the domain configuration set up for the Transporter. Additionally, you need to select the appropriate Transporter from a dropdown menu which becomes available after establishing a connection with the Transporter.
