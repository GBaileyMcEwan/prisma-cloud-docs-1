== Code to Cloud Dashboard

Get a continulously updated snapshot view into the security posture of your cloud environment, streamline tracking and reporting, and eliminate the need to create multiple saved views in various products, with Prisma Cloudâ€™s *Code to Cloud* dashboard. Quickly get answers to questions such as:

* What assets do I have in the cloud?
* What is my organization's security risk posture?
* How do I track progress in securing our cloud infrastructure by application, team, and business unit?
* How can I evaluate my DevOps teams' progress in achieving our key security objectives?

The Code to Cloud Dashboard provides you with metrics and data around each of these key questions, helping you quantify and showcase your progress with your entire security team. Use Prisma Cloud's out of the box Code to Cloud dashboard to track your operational progress across every phase of your application development lifecycle across Code, Build, Deploy and Run. 

*Prerequisites*

To view the Code to Cloud Dashboard, you will need to complete the following tasks:
* Onboard your Cloud Accounts
* Create an alert rule with Incident and Attack Path Policies to detect issues
* Enable Applications Security specifically Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanning
* Enable Agent-based or Agentless security for cloud workload scanning

=== Latest Events Tracker 

The event tracker allows you to check the pulse of your security posture in real time. The *Dashboards > Code to Cloud > Live Event Tracker* provides a stream of updates tracking changes across key metrics such as, Threats Detected, Alerts Remediated, Critical Alerts and more.

Use the Latest Events live stream to quickly assess the potential threat activity taking place in your cloud environment. You then have the option to double-click on any event to investigate critical vulnerabilities and build-time issues detected. Select *See All Events* to see a list of the latest security events across your cloud estate. Select any event to navigate to the specific alert and investigate further. 

=== Cloud Inventory and Graph

Code to Cloud Graphs and Inventory provides a panoramic birds-eye view of your entire cloud estate, helping you understand how well your organization is embracing security best practices across your cloud environment, from individual resources to the entire code pipeline. 


==== Code/Build Inventory

Prisma Cloud's Code/Build Security proactively stops risks from reaching production, helping you address vulnerabilities at the source. The Code/Build Inventory widget surfaces metrics derived from the monitoring and scanning of hundreds of code repositories across the three repository systems secured by Prisma Cloud scanners including IaC/SCA, Secrets, and SAST. Data from developers actively using IDE extensions and interactions with Prisma Cloud Pull Request recommendations are also surfaced.

The *Code Issues in Repositories* graph captures code errors in the default branch of all onboarded repositories over the last thirty days. Use this graph to track your teams progress in resolving code errors before they effect your production systems. 

The *Code and Build Inventory* provides you with a quick rundown of your protected repositories. Select any metric such as *Repositories Systems* to see a full catalog of all the *Code & Build Providers* with flags for Code Issues. *xref when ready*. 

==== Deploy Inventory

The Deploy grpah visualizes the critical and high severity alerts trigerred by vulnerabilities detected in container images in the last 30 days. Here you can monitor trends in the rate of vulnerabilities identified across your cloud estate.

You can also use the Deploy Inventory table to identify at a glance when vulnerable images are deployed in your development environment. For instance, you can select Trusted Images to view images that have been designrated as truted. Here you can also add create rules to control which sources are trusted and which images are allowed to run. *xref when ready*.  

==== Runtime Inventory

The Runtime Inventory widget helps you quantify and demonstrate your progress in securing your workloads. The Runtime graph captures the top critical and high severity incidents and alerts trigerred by attack path policies in the last 30 days. Review the trendline to track your team's progress in the remediation and the burn down of urgent incidents.*xref when ready*

Select any metric on the Runtime Inventory table to view the total number of cloud providers and assets, and workloads protected by agents. For isntance, you can select the Workloads Protected by Agents metric to view potentially compromised workloads that maybe infected with malware.

====
The Inventory data above is sourced from Prisma Cloud Incidents, Attack Paths, Vulnerability Explorer, and IaC scanning data. Percentages are calculated by taking the latest snapshot and data points for the last 30 days and calculating the percentage difference.

=== Top Issues by Collection

The Code to Cloud dashboard, also provides you with the option to define your applications or teams and assign owners to resolve any identified risk. You can compare key metrics such as *Code Issues in Repositories* or *Urgent Vulnerabilities in Images* across teams, business units and applications to benchmark security standards. 

The first row of the table captures the aggregate of all issues across all tenants in your onboarded accounts. Use the *Sort By* drop-down to catgorize your business unit view across Code/Build, Deploy and Run phases of the application lifecycle.

*Add Row* also allows you to create your own custom collection of accounts, application owners or business units to obtain more granular results on risks by individual applications and stakeholders.
