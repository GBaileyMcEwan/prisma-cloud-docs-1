[#upgrade]
=== Upgrade from Previous Releases

[#upgrade-defender]
==== Upgrade Defender Versions 22.06 and Earlier

With the `v32.00` release, https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/compute-edition/32/admin-guide/upgrade/support-lifecycle[Defender versions supported (n, n-1, and n-2)] are `v32.00`, `v31.00`, and `v30.00`.

To prepare for this update, you must upgrade your Defenders from version `v22.06` (Kepler) or earlier to a later version.
Failure to upgrade Defenders will result in disconnection of any Defender version below `v22.12` such as `v22.06`.

//
==== Upcoming Defender Obsolescence

With the upcoming `v33.00` release, release `v30.xx` defenders will be obsolete. To prepare for this coming update, plan for upgrading to release `v31.xx` or later at the earliest. 

[#upgrade-console]
==== Upgrade the Prisma Cloud Console

With the `v32.00` release, the https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/compute-edition/32/admin-guide/upgrade/support-lifecycle[supported Console versions (n, n-1, and n-2)] are `v32.00`, `v31.00`, and `v30.00`.

You can upgrade the Prisma Cloud console directly from any version for n-1 to n.
With `v30.00` as n-1 and `v31.00` as n, you can for example go directly from `v30.01.153` to `v31.00.129`.

You have to upgrade any version of `v22.00` to `v30.00` before upgrading to `v31.00`.
For example, you can upgrade from `v22.12.693` to `v30.02.123` and then upgrade to `v32.00.159`.

|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*Blobstore Scanning Defender Upgrade for Tanzu Customers*
//CWP-56798
|Enhanced the existing blobstore scanning feature for Tanzu customers. As a part of this enhancement, existing blobstore scanning defenders will now appear disconnected and new defender instances will be automatically created to replace them. The disconnected blobstore will disappear after 24 hours as part of the retention process. This upgrade excludes Linux and Windows defenders (Full coverage defenders). If you have configured blobstore scanning and assigned it to a specific blobstore defender after the release of 32.04, you are required to manually edit the configurations and change it to a newly created blobstore defender scanner. This release will also introduce a new tile support - Jimmy for TAS.

//CWP-56557
|*Added Account ID information to the Defenders dashboard*
|Added *Account ID* to the manage Defenders dashboard under *Manage > Defenders*.
The *Account ID* is also included in the downloadable CSV file.

//CWP-56782
|*Enhanced the vulnerability assessment process*
|Prisma Cloud now has an enhanced vulnerability assessment process for applications installed through the OS.
If Prisma Cloud can't detect any vulnerabilities in the vendor feed, it automatically searches for third-party security data to ensure comprehensive security coverage.
Go to *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Vulnerability Explorer* for a comprehensive list of the detected vulnerabilities.

|*Added a new macro for webhook alerts*
|Added the `incidentTime` macro for webhook alerts. The macro shows the time the incident occurred.
For example, `Jan 21, 2018 UTC`.
Go to https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/compute-edition/32/admin-guide/alerts/webhook[Alerts Webhook] to learn more about the macro.

//CWP-56790
|*Added support of Go packages extraction on Windows*
|Defenders now support the extractions of Go packages on Windows.
This package extraction allows the Prisma Cloud Defenders to extract Go packages in zip, tar.gz or tar.bz2 formats.

//CWP-56791
|*Exclude Go CVEs for Windows from the CVEs of Unix-based systems*
|Prisma Cloud now excludes vulnerabilities found in Go packages that are specific to Windows from UNIX based operating systems in the *Vulnerability Explorer*.
Go to *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Vulnerability Explorer* for a comprehensive list of the detected vulnerabilities.
