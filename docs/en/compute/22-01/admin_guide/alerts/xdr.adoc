== Cortex XDR alerts

https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr[Cortex XDR] is a detection and response app that natively integrates network, endpoint and cloud data to stop sophisticated attacks. Prisma Cloud can send runtime alerts to XDR when your policies are violated. Prisma Cloud can be configured to send data when an entire policy, or even specific rules, are violated.

Prisma Cloud uses webhooks to send the alerts to Cortex XDR. When an event occurs, Prisma Cloud notifies the web service with an HTTP POST request that contains a JSON body.
